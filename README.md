# cpkgmgr - a port of pkgmgr to c

**cpkgmgr** is a port of pkgmgr to c  
I intend to make this the main release version  
At that point in time cpkgmgr will be renamed to pkgmgr  

*Dependencies:*  
- wget (package download)  

*Bugs:*  
- Another bug in read_db function at -i (FML)  
  
**cpkgmgr** is 'just' a port of pkgmgr to c
