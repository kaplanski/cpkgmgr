# cpkgmgr - a port of pkgmgr to c

**cpkgmgr** is a port of pkgmgr to c  
I intend to make this the main release version  
At that point in time cpkgmgr will be renamed to pkgmgr  

*Dependencies:*  
- wget (package download)  

*WIP Content:*  
- -ri (reinstall of installed packages)  
- -r (needs to remove entry from installed.db)  

  
**cpkgmgr** is 'just' a port of pkgmgr to c
